# NEW YOARK

**NEW YOARK** is an experiential mobile app to explore the urban city vibe based on the mapping between Top 20 Foreign-born Population vs. Top 20 Most Spoken Languages in NYC (using 2011 dataset). It explores augmented reality as a live direct view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated graphics accompanied by real voices of New Yorkers.

To use this you will need to install openFrameworks for iOS and already have an Apple Developer license because this does not run on the simulator in Xcode.
